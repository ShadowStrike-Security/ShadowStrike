/**
 * @brief How much of the engine's teardown is safe to perform.
 *
 * ScanEngine is a function-local static (Instance()), so if nobody calls
 * Shutdown() while the process is running, its destructor runs during static
 * destruction. That matters because the engine's teardown does two different
 * kinds of work:
 *
 *   - releasing things this object OWNS (its subsystems, its thread pool, its
 *     caches), which is always safe; and
 *   - calling into COLLABORATING SINGLETONS to coordinate their shutdown, which
 *     is only safe while the process is still running.
 *
 * The second kind cannot be done during static destruction, and not because it
 * is risky - because those objects are already gone. Impl::Initialize() is the
 * first code to touch ExecutableAnalyzer::Instance() and PhantomCortex::Instance(),
 * so their construction COMPLETES after ScanEngine's does; block-scope statics are
 * destroyed in reverse order of completed construction, so both are destroyed
 * BEFORE ScanEngine. A destructor that calls Instance().Shutdown() on them is
 * dereferencing storage whose object has already run its destructor.
 *
 * That was the fault: a process which called Initialize() and exited without
 * Shutdown() died with an access violation after all its work had succeeded - the
 * least diagnosable failure there is, because nothing had gone wrong yet. The
 * try/catch around the PhantomCortex call gave the appearance of protection and
 * could never provide it, since an access violation is not a C++ exception.
 *
 * The Logger is deliberately NOT in this category and is safe in either scope:
 * ScanEngine's own constructor logs, so Logger's construction completes first and
 * it is therefore destroyed last.

    // THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. The 1.0.109 field run reported fourteen threats.
    // Every one was false. Five were real executables convicted by heuristics
    // alone, four of them Microsoft operating-system binaries:
    //
    //   System32\d3d11.dll                risk 73.0  Heuristic:Win/Generic
    //   System32\usbmon.dll               risk 63.0  Heuristic:Win/Generic
    //   SysWOW64\IME\IMEJP\IMJPDAPI.DLL   risk 63.0  Heuristic:Win/Packed
    //   System32\drivers\ndis.sys         risk 83.0  Heuristic:Win/Packed
    //   OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe     risk 78     Heur:PE.Suspicious
    //
    // Stage 5 convicts at sensitivityLevel * 30.0, which is 60.0 by default, and
    // Windows system binaries land at 63 to 83. mssmbios.sys scored 53.0 and
    // d2d1.dll 40.0, so this is not a mistuned threshold with a clean margin
    // above it - entropy, packing and import heuristics simply do not separate
    // Microsoft's optimised, resource-heavy, sometimes compressed system
    // binaries from packed malware. Only blocked=0 kept the run harmless; with
    // quarantine enabled 1.0.109 would have taken ndis.sys, and 1.0.93 had
    // already made five attempts on System32\urlmon.dll.
    //
    // THE TRUST THIS CONSULTS WAS ALREADY BEING SEEDED AND NEVER READ.
    // Initialize calls SeedTrustedPublishers, which registers 24 publishers
    // with the reason "Seeded publisher (honoured only with a verified
    // signature)" and logs that "signature-verified vendor binaries now take
    // the fast path". No such path existed: stage 1's only whitelist
    // consultation is a HASH lookup, so the publisher entries were written,
    // persisted, and never queried by anything. WhitelistStore has had
    // IsPublisherWhitelisted all along.
    //
    // WHY THIS IS NOT A WEAKENED DETECTOR, and the distinction is the whole
    // design:
    //
    //   * It cannot fire for evidence-based verdicts. Stages 1 through 4 -
    //     whitelist, hash, threat intel, YARA and pattern matching - every one
    //     jumps to finalize_scan on a hit. Reaching stage 5 therefore MEANS no
    //     signature, hash, IOC or rule matched. The only thing suppressible
    //     here is a score.
    //   * It does not end the scan. The conviction is withheld and the file
    //     CONTINUES through stages 6 to 10 - polymorphic analysis, sandbox,
    //     emulation, zero-day and the ML ensemble. A trusted signature buys a
    //     file no exemption from any detector that reasons about behaviour or
    //     content; it only stops a score from being reported as a threat.
    //   * It requires a VERIFIED signature, not a path, a name or a location. A
    //     file dropped in System32 gets nothing from this.
    //
    // WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. The stolen-certificate check
    // below is wired because SignerInfo carries the thumbprint it needs, but
    // LoadStolenCertDatabase and AddStolenCertificate have ZERO production call
    // sites, so that database is EMPTY on an endpoint today and the check is
    // inert. It is called so the protection engages automatically when the
    // database is populated, and it must not be described as active until then.
    // The property that actually makes this safe is the one above: the file
    // keeps being analysed.
    //
    // COST. Verification runs only when a conviction is about to be reported,
    // not per file. In 1.0.109 that would have been 14 calls against 14,276
    // scans. OfflineOnly is set so no CRL or OCSP fetch can happen - task 48
    // recorded a 180-second CryptSvc wedge from exactly that - and CacheResult
    // is set so a repeated conviction on the same binary is answered from the
    // cache.

    // ScanContext carries `std::chrono::milliseconds timeout` and the on-access caller
    // sets it. Exactly ONE of the fifteen stages below ever read it - stage 4 passes it
    // to the signature scanner as sigScanOpts.timeoutMilliseconds. The other fourteen
    // ignored it completely, so the value described an intention and constrained
    // nothing.
    //
    // WHAT THAT COST, MEASURED IN THE 1.0.112 FIELD RUN. The kernel abandons a file
    // scan after PC_SCAN_TIMEOUT_READ_MS 50, PC_SCAN_TIMEOUT_WRITE_MS 150 or
    // PC_SCAN_TIMEOUT_EXECUTE_MS 500 (PreCreate.h). This function was measured at
    // p95 186 ms, p99 2,205 ms and a maximum of 7,340 ms, with individual stages
    // reaching 14,132 ms (stage 5) and 13,056 ms (stage 6).
    //
    // Every scan that ran past the kernel's budget produced a verdict NOBODY USED - the
    // kernel had already timed out and allowed the file - while still occupying one of
    // only two reply threads. Six such timeouts inside two seconds trip the scan
    // bridge's circuit breaker (SB_CIRCUIT_TIMEOUT_TRIP_COUNT), which then allows files
    // UNSCANNED for a thirty-second recovery window. That run recorded 129 timeouts and
    // 141,048 circuit-open passes against 4,597 files actually scanned: 96.8 percent of
    // everything that reached the scan decision went uninspected, because the work being
    // done for the other 3.2 percent was too slow to be used.
    //
    // SO THIS IS NOT A DETECTION TRADE. It is the difference between a bounded answer
    // for every file and an unbounded answer for a few while the rest are waved
    // through. RealTimeProtection already queues EVERY scanned file to the deferred
    // deep-scan worker unconditionally, and its own comment states the intent this gate
    // completes: the fast path is "a scheduling decision rather than a coverage
    // decision". The thorough pass still runs, moments later, with deepScan set.
